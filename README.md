StorySketch

StorySketch is a minimal generative AI application that transforms simple user prompts into short, structured stories. By leveraging Google Gemini’s advanced storytelling capabilities (via the Node.js SDK), StorySketch delivers rich narratives divided into scenes, each paired with tailored illustration prompts for future text-to-image generation.

Project Overview

StorySketch takes a user’s prompt and generates a fully structured short story, divided into scenes. Each scene includes:

Narrative text

Character dialogue

Setting descriptions

Tailored illustration prompts

The backend is built with Node.js + Express, using Gemini’s generative models (e.g., gemini-1.5-flash or gemini-1.5-pro) to output clean, structured JSON. This makes it easy for the frontend to loop through scenes, display story text, and pair it with AI-generated illustrations.

Future enhancements include integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enrich the story with external knowledge, and text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Imagen, or DALL·E) to turn illustration prompts into contextual images.

Tech Stack and Their Roles
Technology	Role in StorySketch
Google Gemini (Node.js SDK)	Generates structured story data (scenes, dialogues, settings, illustration prompts).
Node.js + Express	Provides the API layer for handling user prompts and returning structured JSON stories.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (planned)	Enriches stories with contextual knowledge from vector databases.
Text-to-Image Models (planned)	Generates illustrations from Gemini’s scene prompts.
Frontend (React / Next.js, etc.) (planned)	Displays story text alongside AI-generated images in a user-friendly format.
Export (HTML/PDF) (planned)	Allows exporting stories into sharable, illustrated formats.
