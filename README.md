🌟 StorySketch

StorySketch is a minimal yet powerful Generative AI storytelling app that transforms simple user prompts into structured, scene-by-scene narratives. Powered by Google Gemini, StorySketch doesn’t just tell stories—it brings them to life with dialogues, vivid settings, and tailored illustration prompts designed for future AI-generated artwork.

🚀 What is StorySketch?

Imagine typing a single line like:

“A young astronaut discovers a secret garden on Mars.”

And instantly receiving a multi-scene short story, complete with:

📖 Narrative text

🎭 Character dialogues

🏞️ Setting descriptions

🎨 Illustration prompts for each scene

StorySketch makes storytelling simple, modular, and ready for visual creativity.
